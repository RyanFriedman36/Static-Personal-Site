<div class= "major-talk">
	<p>The Computer Science curriculum at hamilton College has helped me to build a very strong foundation in decomposing and solving complex problems. The structure of the concentration has thoroughly addressed fundamental practices to prepare me to readily learn new technologies and languages. </p><div class="scct-pic"><img src="photos/scct.png" alt="HC sci center"></div>

	<p>Anthropology has pushed my perspective past the world of computing. I have been able to broaden my capacity to think about and understand the experience of others, particularly those who are different from myself. Being able to study this discipline as well as touch on others has helped me to build a well-rounded academic background.</p>

	<p>Having the privilege of being a member of the Hamilton College Men's Lacrosse program has been instrumental in helping me to develop into the man I am today. I have built incredible friendships through ups, downs and hardwork and have been mentored by three outstanding coaches in Scott Barnard, Cam Stone, and Austin Curtis. </p>
